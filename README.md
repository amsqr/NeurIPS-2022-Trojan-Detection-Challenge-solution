# NeurIPS-2022-Trojan-Detection-Challenge-solution
Solution for the Trojan Detection Challenge (TDC2022 - https://trojandetection.ai) as part of NeurIPS 2022 

The TDC challenge 2022 hosted at NeurIPS, focused on defending image classification models against different attack scenarios which were purposely made hard to detect. My submission to TDC obtained a substantial improvement over existing state-of-the-art with a 43% higher AUC than MNTD, which was the best baseline provided by the task organizers.
